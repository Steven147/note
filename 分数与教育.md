Grades encourage students to learn?

In one word, I think grades can partially encourage students to learn, but it is dangerous when the grades become the only reason for students to learn.

I believe the fundamental purpose for most students in China to study is unclear. Many of us study because everyone around us is devote all their effort into schoolwork, or because we want to enter a perfect college,which is also our parents hope to. We can't find a solid reason for us to learn.

In this case, we simply treat learning as a task, in other words, as problems to solve, or difficulties to overcome. We can't realize the improvement in a variety of aspects during our learning along with the feeling of content, and it's a pity that grades becomes the only feedbacks of our study. Lack of understanding to the study leads to the lack of out motivation.

You may say, if we get a good grades, we are more likely to study willingfully. I agree with this point. For these part of students, grade encourage them to learn. However, it's obvious that if someone make it to the top, there must be other students who can't get their dreamly perfect grades. If they are bind in the low level, no matter whar they choose, to give in or to keep struggling, it has nothing to do with the grades but their own thinking.
